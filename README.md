## Description:
<p> I took a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It was already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end. </p>

<p> These are the following changes done: </p>

1) Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

2) Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

3) Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

<p> Funny enough this is my second attempt trying to get this Search-Engine to work. Originally in my first attempt I ran into a heap of issues then left the project to work on another. After coming back to this project I grew so confused and did not understand where I left off, primarily because of a lack of comments. Because of the mass confusion I decided it'd be better to start the challenge from scratch and retrace my steps on how I set everything up. That made the work process much easier, but I still ran into problems trying to get my Search Engine up and running. Thankfully I was able to sidestep these issues and got everything working! So please, enjoy the Book Search Engine 3000! </p>
